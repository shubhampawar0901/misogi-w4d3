        Introduction to Machine Learning
        
        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.
        
        Types of Machine Learning
        
        There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each type has its own characteristics and applications.
        
        Supervised Learning
        
        Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the correct output is known for each input. Common examples include classification and regression tasks.
        
        Unsupervised Learning
        
        Unsupervised learning deals with finding patterns in data without labeled examples. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical unsupervised learning tasks.
        
        Applications
        
        Machine learning has numerous applications across various industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. The technology continues to evolve and find new use cases.
